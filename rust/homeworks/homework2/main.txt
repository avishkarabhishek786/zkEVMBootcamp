Q. How would you describe the following concepts and how do you rank
them in terms of their importance to you
1. TPS and transaction cost
2. Finality
3. Privacy
4. Decentralisation
5. Security

Ans - 

1. Security - it relates to the robustness of any system and its abitlity to combat 
external attacks meant to steal data. For me, security is upmost important stuff because 
no one would use a app that gets hacked all the time.

2. Finality - transaction finality is a state of the transaction from where we can be 
assured that its data can now not be altered because it has been recorded by several 
miners/network-operators. Finality is rank 2 for me because if a transaction state can 
be altered later on then it makes the whole system not trustworthy.

3. Decentralisation - Decentralisation is a state of the data when it benn shared with multiple
parties. It's rank 3 for me because it ensures data validity.

4. TPS and transaction cost - TPS is how many transactions are being mined every second. 
TPS and transaction cost are important if the application is meant for the mass. Espeacilly 
if the transactions are going to be frequent nobody wants to overpay and/or wait for transaction
execution. 

5. Privacy - Privacy, though very important, is still last thing for me because most of the 
time people require trust on the app. And if the data is public and decentralised it increases
trust. However, privacy matters most if the data shared is between parties/enterprises or if the
data is personal.
